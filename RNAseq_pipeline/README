This pkg contains a set of scripts that automate the RNA-seq upstream data processing from downloading to combining DGE (differential gene expression) lists. 

HOW TO USE ?

1. copy the four scripts to an empty dir where you want to download/align/count your sequencing data

2. configure in "run_RNAseq.sh"
    names of output dir
    data source webpage
    data type
    trimming model as in SE or PE
    maximum reads possible
    indexed reference genome path
    annotation referecen path
    environment variable

3. in RNAseq_module.sh, fine tune parameters for every tool involved and access path of tools if needed.

4. run "run_RNAseq.sh"
